Tag repos for an Open edX release. When run, this script will:

1. Make sure we have an OAuth token for the GitHub API, and help the user
   create one if we don't already have one
2. Fetch the openedx.yaml files from all repos covered by the Open edX release.
3. Identify the repos in that file that are tagged in the Open edX release
4. Identify the commit that needs to be tagged in each repo, tracing cross-repo
   dependencies as necessary
5. Show the identified repos and commits, and ask for confirmation from the user
6. Upon confirmation, create Git tags for the repos using the GitHub API
