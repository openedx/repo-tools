Tag repos for an Open edX release. When run, this script will:

1. Make sure we have an OAuth token for the GitHub API, and help the user
   create one if we don't already have one
2. Fetch the openedx.yaml files from all repos covered by the Open edX release.
3. Identify the repos in that file that are tagged in the Open edX release
4. Identify the commit that needs to be tagged in each repo, tracing cross-repo
   dependencies as necessary
5. Show the identified repos and commits, and ask for confirmation from the user
6. Upon confirmation, create Git tags for the repos using the GitHub API

    Delete the ref `ref` from each repository in `repos`.

    This function returns True if any repos had the reference removed,

    to remove a ref from a repo, the function will continue trying to
    remove refs from all the other repos in the iterable -- but after all repos
    have been attempted, this function will raise a TagReleaseError with
    a list of all the repos that did not have the ref removed.
    Trying to remove a ref from a repo that does not have that ref
    to begin with is *not* treated as an error.

    Arguments:
        repos: An iterable of Repository objects.
        ref (str): the ref to remove.
        use_tag (bool): ref is a tag (True) or a branch (False).
