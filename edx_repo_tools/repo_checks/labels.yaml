# Repository labels to be synced across the entire org.
# Every item must have a name, color, and description.

# Notes:
# * Repositories may define their own labels as long as they don't
#   conflict with what's listed here. If it turns out a repository-specific
#   label would be useful to have in the entire organization, we can always add
#   it here post facto.
# * We have added these based on need. They are not all-encompassing. If something
#   seems missing, feel free to open a PR.
# * Whenever a repo has a matching label, that label will be updated. If there
#   is no matching label, the label will be created anew. "Matching" is determined
#   by comparing the label's lowercased name, with all puncutation, emoji, and special
#   chars removed.
# * For picking hex colors, you might use: https://www.color-hex.com/
#   Describe your color with a comment so it's easier to review.

# Waiting for the author to respond to change requests, feedback, failing
# tests, etc. Usually this label is used for PRs in board statuses other
# than “Waiting for Author” (e.g. the pull request is “In Eng Review”
# column on the board, but the author needs to address review feedback).
- name: "waiting on author"
  color: "bfd6f6"  # baby blue
  description: "PR author needs to resolve review requests, answer questions, fix tests, etc."

# Used by the PR Triage team to indicate when an author has done all work needed
# to have this PR be reviewed by an engineer.  The goal is to make it easier for
# reviewing users/teams to know when their attention is needed.  Similar to "waiting on author"
# this label is used when the board does not have a relevant status column but need to convey
# this information.  (e.g. It was set to "In eng review" and the author has addressed all change
# requests.)
- name: "waiting for eng review"
  color: "ebe534" # bright yellow
  description: "PR is ready for review. Review and merge it, or suggest changes."

# Used by review teams to indicate that a PR or Issue specifically needs the attention of the maintainers
# and can't be handled by CCs.  The PR Triage team is not expected to use this label. It is expecetd to
# be used by teams that coordinate upgrades such as the Arbi-BOM team or by triagers at the team level who
# filter work that needs to be done by the maintaining team vs CCs.
- name: "needs maintainer attention"
  color: "ebb134" # orange
