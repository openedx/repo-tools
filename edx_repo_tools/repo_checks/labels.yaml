# Repository labels to be synced across the entire org.
# Every item must have a name, color, and description.

# Notes:
# * Repositories may define their own labels as long as they don't
#   conflict with what's listed here. If it turns out a repository-specific
#   label would be useful to have in the entire organization, we can always add
#   it here post facto.
# * We have added these based on need. They are not all-encompassing. If something
#   seems missing, feel free to open a PR.
# * Whenever a repo has a matching label, that label will be updated. If there
#   is no matching label, the label will be created anew. "Matching" is determined
#   by comparing the label's lowercased name, with all puncutation, emoji, and special
#   chars removed.
# * For picking hex colors, you might use: https://www.color-hex.com/
#   Describe your color with a comment so it's easier to review.

# column on the board, but the author needs to address review feedback).

# to have this PR be reviewed by an engineer.  The goal is to make it easier for
# reviewing users/teams to know when their attention is needed.  Similar to "waiting on author"
# this label is used when the board does not have a relevant status column but need to convey
# this information.  (e.g. It was set to "In eng review" and the author has addressed all change
# requests.)

# filter work that needs to be done by the maintaining team vs CCs.
